Modern Portfolio Theory: alocamento de recursos baseado em alguns pesos
 - expected return for portfolio
 - risk is volatility
     - volatility is something to do with **standard deviation** and **variance**
     - **covariance** measures how much two random variables vary together
      - $covariance < 0 **moves inversely**
      - $covariance > 0 **moves together**
      
 - **Markowitz theory**
  - high positive covariance does not provide very much diversification
  - the aim to diversification is to eliminate the fluctuactions
    - **uncorrelated stocks are better**
  - for calculate the variance  of the portfolio we need the covariance matrix containing all
    the covariance of the stocks in portfolio.
    - covariance matrix: correlation between the stocks
    
  - output from modern portfolio is expected variance/return matrix
   - Efficient frontier are the portfolio that has high return and minor risk THE EDGE!
   
  - Sharper ratio - risk/return measure
   - it describes how much excess return you are receiving for extra volatility that 
   you endure holding a riskier asset.
   - sharpe-ratio **S(x) > 1** is considered to be **good**, high better
